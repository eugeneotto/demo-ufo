# ufo task calls run_tasks
#
# Internally, ufo will adjust the run_task parameters based no the
# task definition being deployed.
# If it is a Fargate task definition, network_configurations will automatically
# be added.
# If it is a EC2 task definition, network_configurations are not added.
#
# Adjust this if you would like to override the default parameters passed to
# run_task by ufo.
#
# run_task:
#   launch_type: FARGATE # required if using fargate
#   # network_configuration is required for FARGATE
#   network_configuration:
#     awsvpc_configuration:
#       subnets: <%= network[:ecs_subnets].inspect %> # required
#       security_groups: <%= network[:ecs_security_groups].inspect %>
#       assign_public_ip: "ENABLED" # accepts ENABLED, DISABLED
